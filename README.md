EFI file for macOS Sequoia 15.1.1 on Surface Laptop 3 (mine is i7 13.5").

Based on the great work done by jc-bao [here](https://github.com/jc-bao/surface-laptop3-macos).

No need to downgrade firmware, should work out of the box with OpenCore. Just replace the "OC" folder with mine. The "BOOT" folder has some other stuff in it for my Linux boot, so be warned!

You'll need to input your own SMBIOS :)

Happy hacking, and feel free to post an issue with any questions! The Hackintosh subreddit is also helpful, but a little gatekeep-y, so be warned about asking questions on there.
